BRazilian Online Web Special EDitor

At some point I got curious about how far one could go overwriting browser shortcuts through client-side technologies. I decided to use AJAX and managed to implement a few (by now) shortcuts I enjoy in my favorite editor (vim) and terminal emulator (zsh).

I felt it was something worthy sharing with the community and tried to make up a funny name, since it's nothing more than a momentary hobby. Browsed came up, since it's used by means of a web browser.
